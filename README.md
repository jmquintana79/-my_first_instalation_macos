# My Settings for Ubuntu OS and MacOS

## bash_profile

Here I am going to store my custom **.bash_profile" for Ubuntu Os and MacOS. 

- for Ubuntu: include this content in the end of ```~/.bashrc```.
- for MacOS: include this content in the end of ```~/bash_profile```.

## Jarvis: terminal personal assistant 

### for Ubuntu
```
$ cd Ubuntu/jarvis_assistant
$ make install # only is working for Python2
$ make run
```
